Make it so the user can see a list (horizontal of course) of special characters and chose which one or ones to use, have them go into an array that the generatePassword function draws from.  As a last resort you may have to use jQuery to do this.

****IMPORTANT*****Using dashes and the way the generatePassword function loops operates, you will never get 5 characters and a dash.  The only way to make it work is to loop 5 times for a 5 character string.  If dashes are used or not the 5 character string is concatinated with its previous until it nearly reaches the inputtedNumber amount.  At that point we use a conditional to get us there.
