You should make it so the function callers to add numbers or special characters or dashes is pushed into an array, then a randomizer randomly picks how often to call that function.  Right now each of the functions are being called in order.

Make the dashes function work.  Not sure if I want the dashes to randomize.

Make the vowels work more often in the string.

Fix the pushing of function callers into arrays where the checkboxes are either true or false so that the function caller is spliced out even when the check box is double clicked"
