Make it so the user can see a list (horizontal of course) of special characters and chose which one or ones to use, have them go into an array that the generatePassword function draws from.  As a last resort you may have to use jQuery to do this.

Styling - Use media queries for small phone, large phone, tablet, and laptop.  You need the practice. Also, the reason that I want media queries especially for the smaller screans is because I need to scrunch things in tighter so the use can see pretty much everything that is happening without having to scroll up or down the page.

If you were to limit the length of the password to say, 127 characters, doing it with min and max in the html isn't working right now.  I think it will have to be done with javascript.

make it so user can continue to click "generate new password" button and have it create new passwords with the original entered amount of characters.
