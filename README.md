Ever wanted to have a password created for you that is unique that you don't want to spend time trying to think up?  Generate one and memorize it later.  You will still have to either write it down or copy and paste it.
Chose to have a password with only letters, letters with dashes, with numbers, and special characters.

I built this quick and simple app to give me practice with "vanilla" JavaScript.  I was trained to use Angular 1.xx with limited knowlege of JavaScript and decided to see if I could put something together without the help of the Angular framework.
The app is just one page with a single html file, a single js file, and a single css file.
I have extensively used for loops and Math.random() for each character added to the newPassword string, taken out of multiple arrays.
